## Expand description

A contiguous growable array type, written as `Vec<T>`, short for ‘vector’.

## §Examples

```
let mut vec = Vec::new();
vec.push(1);
vec.push(2);
assert_eq!(vec.len(), 2);
assert_eq!(vec[0], 1);
assert_eq!(vec.pop(), Some(2));
assert_eq!(vec.len(), 1);
vec[0] = 7;
assert_eq!(vec[0], 7);
vec.extend([1, 2, 3]);
for x in &vec {
    println!("{x}");
}
assert_eq!(vec, [7, 1, 2, 3]);
```
The `vec!` macro is provided for convenient initialization:

```
let mut vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
vec1.push(4);
let vec2 = Vec::from([1, 2, 3, 4]);
assert_eq!(vec1, vec2);
```
It can also initialize each element of a `Vec<T>` with a given value.
This may be more efficient than performing allocation and initialization
in separate steps, especially when initializing a vector of zeros:

```
let vec = vec![0; 5];
assert_eq!(vec, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]);
// The following is equivalent, but potentially slower:
let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(5);
vec.resize(5, 0);
assert_eq!(vec, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]);
```
For more information, see Capacity and Reallocation.

Use a `Vec<T>` as an efficient stack:

```
let mut stack = Vec::new();
stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);
stack.push(3);
while let Some(top) = stack.pop() {
    // Prints 3, 2, 1
    println!("{top}");
}
```
## §Indexing

The `Vec` type allows access to values by index, because it implements the
`Index` trait. An example will be more explicit:

However be careful: if you try to access an index which isn’t in the `Vec`,
your software will panic! You cannot do this:

Use `get` and `get_mut` if you want to check whether the index is in
the `Vec`.

## §Slicing

A `Vec` can be mutable. On the other hand, slices are read-only objects.
To get a slice, use `&`. Example:

```
fn read_slice(slice: &[usize]) {
    // ...
}
let v = vec![0, 1];
read_slice(&v);
// ... and that's all!
// you can also do it like this:
let u: &[usize] = &v;
// or like this:
let u: &[_] = &v;
```
In Rust, it’s more common to pass slices as arguments rather than vectors
when you just want to provide read access. The same goes for `String` and
`&str`.

## §Capacity and reallocation

The capacity of a vector is the amount of space allocated for any future
elements that will be added onto the vector. This is not to be confused with
the *length* of a vector, which specifies the number of actual elements
within the vector. If a vector’s length exceeds its capacity, its capacity
will automatically be increased, but its elements will have to be
reallocated.

For example, a vector with capacity 10 and length 0 would be an empty vector
with space for 10 more elements. Pushing 10 or fewer elements onto the
vector will not change its capacity or cause reallocation to occur. However,
if the vector’s length is increased to 11, it will have to reallocate, which
can be slow. For this reason, it is recommended to use `Vec::with_capacity`
whenever possible to specify how big the vector is expected to get.

## §Guarantees

Due to its incredibly fundamental nature, `Vec` makes a lot of guarantees
about its design. This ensures that it’s as low-overhead as possible in
the general case, and can be correctly manipulated in primitive ways
by unsafe code. Note that these guarantees refer to an unqualified `Vec<T>`.
If additional type parameters are added (e.g., to support custom allocators),
overriding their defaults may change the behavior.

Most fundamentally, `Vec` is and always will be a (pointer, capacity, length)
triplet. No more, no less. The order of these fields is completely
unspecified, and you should use the appropriate methods to modify these.
The pointer will never be null, so this type is null-pointer-optimized.

However, the pointer might not actually point to allocated memory. In particular,
if you construct a `Vec` with capacity 0 via `Vec::new`, `vec![]`,
`Vec::with_capacity(0)`, or by calling `shrink_to_fit`
on an empty Vec, it will not allocate memory. Similarly, if you store zero-sized
types inside a `Vec`, it will not allocate space for them. *Note that in this case
the  Vec might not report a capacity of 0*. 

`Vec` will allocate if and only
if `size_of::<T>() * capacity() > 0`. In general, `Vec`’s allocation
details are very subtle — if you intend to allocate memory using a `Vec`
and use it for something else (either to pass to unsafe code, or to build your
own memory-backed collection), be sure to deallocate this memory by using
`from_raw_parts` to recover the `Vec` and then dropping it.If a `Vec` *has* allocated memory, then the memory it points to is on the heap
(as defined by the allocator Rust is configured to use by default), and its
pointer points to `len` initialized, contiguous elements in order (what
you would see if you coerced it to a slice), followed by `capacity - len`
logically uninitialized, contiguous elements.

A vector containing the elements `'a'` and `'b'` with capacity 4 can be
visualized as below. The top part is the `Vec` struct, it contains a
pointer to the head of the allocation in the heap, length and capacity.
The bottom part is the allocation on the heap, a contiguous memory block.

```
            ptr      len  capacity
       +--------+--------+--------+
       | 0x0123 |      2 |      4 |
       +--------+--------+--------+
            |
            v
Heap   +--------+--------+--------+--------+
       |    'a' |    'b' | uninit | uninit |
       +--------+--------+--------+--------+
```
- **uninit**represents memory that is not initialized, see- `MaybeUninit`.
- Note: the ABI is not stable and `Vec`makes no guarantees about its memory layout (including the order of fields).

`Vec` will never perform a “small optimization” where elements are actually
stored on the stack for two reasons:

- 
It would make it more difficult for unsafe code to correctly manipulate a `Vec`. The contents of a`Vec`wouldn’t have a stable address if it were only moved, and it would be more difficult to determine if a`Vec`had actually allocated memory.
- 
It would penalize the general case, incurring an additional branch on every access. 

`Vec` will never automatically shrink itself, even if completely empty. This
ensures no unnecessary allocations or deallocations occur. Emptying a `Vec`
and then filling it back up to the same `len` should incur no calls to
the allocator. If you wish to free up unused memory, use
`shrink_to_fit` or `shrink_to`.

`push` and `insert` will never (re)allocate if the reported capacity is
sufficient. `push` and `insert` *will* (re)allocate if
`len == capacity`. That is, the reported capacity is completely
accurate, and can be relied on. It can even be used to manually free the memory
allocated by a `Vec` if desired. Bulk insertion methods *may* reallocate, even
when not necessary.

`Vec` does not guarantee any particular growth strategy when reallocating
when full, nor when `reserve` is called. The current strategy is basic
and it may prove desirable to use a non-constant growth factor. Whatever
strategy is used will of course guarantee *O*(1) amortized `push`.

It is guaranteed, in order to respect the intentions of the programmer, that
all of `vec![e_1, e_2, ..., e_n]`, `vec![x; n]`, and `Vec::with_capacity(n)` produce a `Vec`
that requests an allocation of the exact size needed for precisely `n` elements from the allocator,
and no other size (such as, for example: a size rounded up to the nearest power of 2).
The allocator will return an allocation that is at least as large as requested, but it may be larger.

It is guaranteed that the `Vec::capacity` method returns a value that is at least the requested capacity
and not more than the allocated capacity.

The method `Vec::shrink_to_fit` will attempt to discard excess capacity an allocator has given to a `Vec`.
If `len == capacity`, then a `Vec<T>` can be converted
to and from a `Box<[T]>` without reallocating or moving the elements.
`Vec` exploits this fact as much as reasonable when implementing common conversions
such as `into_boxed_slice`.

`Vec` will not specifically overwrite any data that is removed from it,
but also won’t specifically preserve it. Its uninitialized memory is
scratch space that it may use however it wants. It will generally just do
whatever is most efficient or otherwise easy to implement. Do not rely on
removed data to be erased for security purposes. Even if you drop a `Vec`, its
buffer may simply be reused by another allocation. Even if you zero a `Vec`’s memory
first, that might not actually happen because the optimizer does not consider
this a side-effect that must be preserved. There is one case which we will
not break, however: using `unsafe` code to write to the excess capacity,
and then increasing the length to match, is always valid.

Currently, `Vec` does not guarantee the order in which elements are dropped.
The order has changed in the past and may change again.

## Implementations§

Source§### impl<T> Vec<T>

 

### impl<T> Vec<T>

1.0.0 (const: 1.39.0) · Source#### pub const fn new() -> Vec<T>

 

#### pub const fn new() -> Vec<T>

Constructs a new, empty `Vec<T>`.

The vector will not allocate until elements are pushed onto it.

##### §Examples

1.0.0 (const: unstable) · Source#### pub fn with_capacity(capacity: usize) -> Vec<T>

 

#### pub fn with_capacity(capacity: usize) -> Vec<T>

Constructs a new, empty `Vec<T>` with at least the specified capacity.

The vector will be able to hold at least `capacity` elements without
reallocating. This method is allowed to allocate for more elements than
`capacity`. If `capacity` is zero, the vector will not allocate.

It is important to note that although the returned vector has the
minimum *capacity* specified, the vector will have a zero *length*. For
an explanation of the difference between length and capacity, see
*Capacity and reallocation*.

If it is important to know the exact allocated capacity of a `Vec`,
always use the `capacity` method after construction.

For `Vec<T>` where `T` is a zero-sized type, there will be no allocation
and the capacity will always be `usize::MAX`.

##### §Panics

Panics if the new capacity exceeds `isize::MAX` *bytes*.

##### §Examples

```
let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(10);
// The vector contains no items, even though it has capacity for more
assert_eq!(vec.len(), 0);
assert!(vec.capacity() >= 10);
// These are all done without reallocating...
for i in 0..10 {
    vec.push(i);
}
assert_eq!(vec.len(), 10);
assert!(vec.capacity() >= 10);
// ...but this may make the vector reallocate
vec.push(11);
assert_eq!(vec.len(), 11);
assert!(vec.capacity() >= 11);
// A vector of a zero-sized type will always over-allocate, since no
// allocation is necessary
let vec_units = Vec::<()>::with_capacity(10);
assert_eq!(vec_units.capacity(), usize::MAX);
```
Source#### pub fn try_with_capacity(capacity: usize) -> Result<Vec<T>, TryReserveError>

 🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`try_with_capacity` #91913)

#### pub fn try_with_capacity(capacity: usize) -> Result<Vec<T>, TryReserveError>

`try_with_capacity` #91913)Constructs a new, empty `Vec<T>` with at least the specified capacity.

The vector will be able to hold at least `capacity` elements without
reallocating. This method is allowed to allocate for more elements than
`capacity`. If `capacity` is zero, the vector will not allocate.

##### §Errors

Returns an error if the capacity exceeds `isize::MAX` *bytes*,
or if the allocator reports allocation failure.

1.0.0 (const: unstable) · Source#### pub unsafe fn from_raw_parts(
    ptr: *mut T,
    length: usize,
    capacity: usize,
) -> Vec<T>

 

#### pub unsafe fn from_raw_parts( ptr: *mut T, length: usize, capacity: usize, ) -> Vec<T>

Creates a `Vec<T>` directly from a pointer, a length, and a capacity.

##### §Safety

This is highly unsafe, due to the number of invariants that aren’t checked:

- If `T`is not a zero-sized type and the capacity is nonzero,`ptr`must have been allocated using the global allocator, such as via the`alloc::alloc`function. If`T`is a zero-sized type or the capacity is zero,`ptr`need only be non-null and aligned.
- `T`needs to have the same alignment as what- `ptr`was allocated with, if the pointer is required to be allocated. (- `T`having a less strict alignment is not sufficient, the alignment really needs to be equal to satisfy the- `dealloc`requirement that memory must be allocated and deallocated with the same layout.)
- The size of `T`times the`capacity`(i.e. the allocated size in bytes), if nonzero, needs to be the same size as the pointer was allocated with. (Because similar to alignment,`dealloc`must be called with the same layout`size`.)
- `length`needs to be less than or equal to- `capacity`.
- The first `length`values must be properly initialized values of type`T`.
- `capacity`needs to be the capacity that the pointer was allocated with, if the pointer is required to be allocated.
- The allocated size in bytes must be no larger than `isize::MAX`. See the safety documentation of`pointer::offset`.

These requirements are always upheld by any `ptr` that has been allocated
via `Vec<T>`. Other allocation sources are allowed if the invariants are
upheld.

Violating these may cause problems like corrupting the allocator’s
internal data structures. For example it is normally **not** safe
to build a `Vec<u8>` from a pointer to a C `char` array with length
`size_t`, doing so is only safe if the array was initially allocated by
a `Vec` or `String`.
It’s also not safe to build one from a `Vec<u16>` and its length, because
the allocator cares about the alignment, and these two types have different
alignments. The buffer was allocated with alignment 2 (for `u16`), but after
turning it into a `Vec<u8>` it’ll be deallocated with alignment 1. To avoid
these issues, it is often preferable to do casting/transmuting using
`slice::from_raw_parts` instead.

The ownership of `ptr` is effectively transferred to the
`Vec<T>` which may then deallocate, reallocate or change the
contents of memory pointed to by the pointer at will. Ensure
that nothing else uses the pointer after calling this
function.

##### §Examples

```
use std::ptr;
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
// Deconstruct the vector into parts.
let (p, len, cap) = v.into_raw_parts();
unsafe {
    // Overwrite memory with 4, 5, 6
    for i in 0..len {
        ptr::write(p.add(i), 4 + i);
    }
    // Put everything back together into a Vec
    let rebuilt = Vec::from_raw_parts(p, len, cap);
    assert_eq!(rebuilt, [4, 5, 6]);
}
```

        let mem = alloc(layout).cast::<u32>();
        if mem.is_null() {
            return;
        }
        mem.write(1_000_000);
        Vec::from_raw_parts(mem, 1, 16)
    };
    assert_eq!(vec, &[1_000_000]);
    assert_eq!(vec.capacity(), 16);
}
```

Source#### pub fn from_fn<F>(length: usize, f: F) -> Vec<T>

 🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`vec_from_fn` #149698)

#### pub fn from_fn<F>(length: usize, f: F) -> Vec<T>

`vec_from_fn` #149698)Creates a `Vec<T>` where each element is produced by calling `f` with
that element’s index while walking forward through the `Vec<T>`.

This is essentially the same as writing

`vec![f(0), f(1), f(2), …, f(length - 2), f(length - 1)]`and is similar to `(0..i).map(f)`, just for `Vec<T>`s not iterators.

If `length == 0`, this produces an empty `Vec<T>` without ever calling `f`.

##### §Example

```
#![feature(vec_from_fn)]
let vec = Vec::from_fn(5, |i| i);
// indexes are:  0  1  2  3  4
assert_eq!(vec, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]);
let vec2 = Vec::from_fn(8, |i| i * 2);
// indexes are:   0  1  2  3  4  5   6   7
assert_eq!(vec2, [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]);
let bool_vec = Vec::from_fn(5, |i| i % 2 == 0);
// indexes are:       0     1      2     3      4
assert_eq!(bool_vec, [true, false, true, false, true]);
```
The `Vec<T>` is generated in ascending index order, starting from the front
and going towards the back, so you can use closures with mutable state:

1.93.0 (const: unstable) · Source#### pub fn into_raw_parts(self) -> (*mut T, usize, usize)

 

#### pub fn into_raw_parts(self) -> (*mut T, usize, usize)

Decomposes a `Vec<T>` into its raw components: `(pointer, length, capacity)`.

Returns the raw pointer to the underlying data, the length of
the vector (in elements), and the allocated capacity of the
data (in elements). These are the same arguments in the same
order as the arguments to `from_raw_parts`.

After calling this function, the caller is responsible for the
memory previously managed by the `Vec`. Most often, one does
this by converting the raw pointer, length, and capacity back
into a `Vec` with the `from_raw_parts` function; more generally,
if `T` is non-zero-sized and the capacity is nonzero, one may use
any method that calls `dealloc` with a layout of
`Layout::array::<T>(capacity)`; if `T` is zero-sized or the
capacity is zero, nothing needs to be done.

capacity after the push, *O*(*capacity*) time is taken to copy the
vector’s elements to a larger allocation. This expensive operation is
offset by the *capacity* *O*(1) insertions it allows.

#### pub const unsafe fn from_raw_parts_in( ptr: *mut T, length: usize, capacity: usize, alloc: A, ) -> Vec<T, A>

`allocator_api` #32838)Creates a `Vec<T, A>` directly from a pointer, a length, a capacity,
and an allocator.

##### §Safety

This is highly unsafe, due to the number of invariants that aren’t checked:

- `ptr`must be- *currently allocated*via the given allocator- `alloc`.
- `T`needs to have the same alignment as what- `ptr`was allocated with. (- `T`having a less strict alignment is not sufficient, the alignment really needs to be equal to satisfy the- `dealloc`requirement that memory must be allocated and deallocated with the same layout.)
- The size of `T`times the`capacity`(i.e. the allocated size in bytes) needs to be the same size as the pointer was allocated with. (Because similar to alignment,`dealloc`must be called with the same layout`size`.)
- `length`needs to be less than or equal to- `capacity`.
- The first `length`values must be properly initialized values of type`T`.
- `capacity`needs to- *fit*the layout size that the pointer was allocated with.
- The allocated size in bytes must be no larger than `isize::MAX`. See the safety documentation of`pointer::offset`.

These requirements are always upheld by any `ptr` that has been allocated
via `Vec<T, A>`. Other allocation sources are allowed if the invariants are
upheld.

Violating these may cause problems like corrupting the allocator’s
internal data structures. For example it is **not** safe
to build a `Vec<u8>` from a pointer to a C `char` array with length `size_t`.
It’s also not safe to build one from a `Vec<u16>` and its length, because
the allocator cares about the alignment, and these two types have different
alignments. The buffer was allocated with alignment 2 (for `u16`), but after
turning it into a `Vec<u8>` it’ll be deallocated with alignment 1.

The ownership of `ptr` is effectively transferred to the
`Vec<T>` which may then deallocate, reallocate or change the
contents of memory pointed to by the pointer at will. Ensure
that nothing else uses the pointer after calling this
function.

no effect.

The `drain` method can emulate `truncate`, but causes the excess

No truncation occurs when `len` is greater than the vector’s current
length:

Truncating when `len == 0` is equivalent to calling the `clear`
method.

#### pub const fn as_ptr(&self) -> *const T

Returns a raw pointer to the vector’s buffer, or a dangling raw pointer valid for zero sized reads if the vector didn’t allocate.

The caller must ensure that the vector outlives the pointer this function returns, or else it will end up dangling. Modifying the vector may cause its buffer to be reallocated, which would also make any pointers to it invalid.

The caller must also ensure that the memory the pointer (non-transitively) points to
is never written to (except inside an `UnsafeCell`) using this pointer or any pointer
derived from it. If you need to mutate the contents of the slice, use `as_mut_ptr`.

This method guarantees that for the purpose of the aliasing model, this method
does not materialize a reference to the underlying slice, and thus the returned pointer
will remain valid when mixed with other calls to `as_ptr`, `as_mut_ptr`,
and `as_non_null`.
Note that calling other methods that materialize mutable references to the slice,
or mutable references to specific elements you are planning on accessing through this pointer,
as well as writing to those elements, may still invalidate this pointer.
See the second example below for how this guarantee can be used.

##### §Examples

```
let x = vec![1, 2, 4];
let x_ptr = x.as_ptr();
unsafe {
    for i in 0..x.len() {

or references to specific elements you are planning on accessing through this pointer,
may still invalidate this pointer.
See the second example below for how this guarantee can be used.

The method also guarantees that, as long as `T` is not zero-sized and the capacity is
nonzero, the pointer may be passed into `dealloc` with a layout of
`Layout::array::<T>(capacity)` in order to deallocate the backing memory. If this is done,
be careful not to run the destructor of the `Vec`, as dropping it will result in
double-frees. Wrapping the `Vec` in a `ManuallyDrop` is the typical way to achieve this.

##### §Examples

    }

#### pub unsafe fn set_len(&mut self, new_len: usize)

Forces the length of the vector to `new_len`.

This is a low-level operation that maintains none of the normal
invariants of the type. Normally changing the length of a vector
is done using one of the safe operations instead, such as
`truncate`, `resize`, `extend`, or `clear`.

##### §Safety

- `new_len`must be less than or equal to- `capacity()`.
- The elements at `old_len..new_len`must be initialized.

##### §Examples

See `spare_capacity_mut()` for an example with safe
initialization of capacity elements and use of this method.

`set_len()` can be useful for situations in which the vector
is serving as a buffer for other code, particularly over FFI:

```
pub fn get_dictionary(&self) -> Option<Vec<u8>> {
    // Per the FFI method's docs, "32768 bytes is always enough".
    let mut dict = Vec::with_capacity(32_768);
    let mut dict_length = 0;
    // SAFETY: When `deflateGetDictionary` returns `Z_OK`, it holds that:
    // 1. `dict_length` elements were initialized.
    // 2. `dict_length` <= the capacity (32_768)
    // which makes `set_len` safe to call.
    unsafe {
        // Make the FFI call...
        let r = deflateGetDictionary(self.strm, dict.as_mut_ptr(), &mut dict_length);
        if r == Z_OK {
            // ...and update the length to what was initialized.
            dict.set_len(dict_length);
            Some(dict)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}
```
While the following example is sound, there is a memory leak since
the inner vectors were not freed prior to the `set_len` call:

```
let mut vec = vec![vec![1, 0, 0],
                   vec![0, 1, 0],
                   vec![0, 0, 1]];
// SAFETY:
// 1. `old_len..0` is empty so no elements need to be initialized.
// 2. `0 <= capacity` always holds whatever `capacity` is.
unsafe {
    vec.set_len(0);
}
```
Normally, here, one would use `clear` instead to correctly drop
the contents and thus not leak memory.

#### pub fn swap_remove(&mut self, index: usize) -> T

Removes an element from the vector and returns it.

The removed element is replaced by the last element of the vector.

This does not preserve ordering of the remaining elements, but is *O*(1).
If you need to preserve the element order, use `remove` instead.

#### pub fn remove(&mut self, index: usize) -> T

Removes and returns the element at position `index` within the vector,
shifting all elements after it to the left.

Note: Because this shifts over the remaining elements, it has a
worst-case performance of *O*(*n*). If you don’t need the order of elements
to be preserved, use `swap_remove` instead. If you’d like to remove
elements from the beginning of the `Vec`, consider using

#### pub fn retain<F>(&mut self, f: F)

Retains only the elements specified by the predicate.

In other words, remove all elements `e` for which `f(&e)` returns `false`.
This method operates in place, visiting each element exactly once in the
original order, and preserves the order of the retained elements.

##### §Examples

Because the elements are visited exactly once in the original order, external state may be used to decide which elements to keep.

If the vector is sorted, this removes all duplicates.

##### §Examples

1.16.0 · Source#### pub fn dedup_by<F>(&mut self, same_bucket: F)

 

#### pub fn dedup_by<F>(&mut self, same_bucket: F)

Removes all but the first of consecutive elements in the vector satisfying a given equality relation.

The `same_bucket` function is passed references to two elements from the vector and
must determine if the elements compare equal. The elements are passed in opposite order
from their order in the slice, so if `same_bucket(a, b)` returns `true`, `a` is removed.

If the vector is sorted, this removes all duplicates.

#### pub fn drain<R>(&mut self, range: R) -> Drain<'_, T, A> ⓘwhere
    R: RangeBounds<usize>,

Removes the subslice indicated by the given range from the vector, returning a double-ended iterator over the removed subslice.

If the iterator is dropped before being fully consumed, it drops the remaining removed elements.

The returned iterator keeps a mutable borrow on the vector to optimize its implementation.

##### §Panics

Panics if the range has `start_bound > end_bound`, or, if the range is
bounded on either end and past the length of the vector.

##### §Leaking

If the returned iterator goes out of scope without being dropped (due to
`mem::forget`, for example), the vector may have lost and leaked
elements arbitrarily, including elements outside the range.

##### §Examples

#### pub fn split_off(&mut self, at: usize) -> Vec<T, A>where
    A: Clone,

Splits the collection into two at the given index.

Returns a newly allocated vector containing the elements in the range
`[at, len)`. After the call, the original vector will be left containing
the elements `[0, at)` with its previous capacity unchanged.

- If you want to take ownership of the entire contents and capacity of
the vector, see `mem::take`or`mem::replace`.
- If you don’t need the returned vector at all, see `Vec::truncate`.
- If you want to take ownership of an arbitrary subslice, or you don’t
necessarily want to store the removed items in a vector, see `Vec::drain`.

##### §Panics

Panics if `at > len`.

##### §Examples

1.33.0 · Source#### pub fn resize_with<F>(&mut self, new_len: usize, f: F)where
    F: FnMut() -> T,

 

#### pub fn resize_with<F>(&mut self, new_len: usize, f: F)where
    F: FnMut() -> T,

Resizes the `Vec` in-place so that `len` is equal to `new_len`.

If `new_len` is greater than `len`, the `Vec` is extended by the
difference, with each additional slot filled with the result of
calling the closure `f`. The return values from `f` will end up
in the `Vec` in the order they have been generated.

If `new_len` is less than `len`, the `Vec` is simply truncated.

This method uses a closure to create new values on every push. If
you’d rather `Clone` a given value, use `Vec::resize`. If you
want to use the `Default` trait to generate values, you can
pass `Default::default` as the second argument.

##### §Panics

Panics if the new capacity exceeds `isize::MAX` *bytes*.

##### §Examples

1.47.0 · Source#### pub fn leak<'a>(self) -> &'a mut [T]where
    A: 'a,

 

#### pub fn leak<'a>(self) -> &'a mut [T]where
    A: 'a,

Consumes and leaks the `Vec`, returning a mutable reference to the contents,
`&'a mut [T]`.

Note that the type `T` must outlive the chosen lifetime `'a`. If the type
has only static references, or none at all, then this may be chosen to be
`'static`.

As of Rust 1.57, this method does not reallocate or shrink the `Vec`,
so the leaked allocation may include unused capacity that is not part
of the returned slice.

This function is mainly useful for data that lives for the remainder of the program’s life. Dropping the returned reference will cause a memory leak.

##### §Examples

Simple usage:

1.60.0 · Source#### pub fn spare_capacity_mut(&mut self) -> &mut [MaybeUninit<T>]

 

#### pub fn spare_capacity_mut(&mut self) -> &mut [MaybeUninit<T>]

`MaybeUninit<T>`.

The returned slice can be used to fill the vector with data (e.g. by
reading from a file) before marking the data as initialized using the
`set_len` method.

##### §Examples

```
// Allocate vector big enough for 10 elements.

// Fill in the first 3 elements.
let uninit = v.spare_capacity_mut();
uninit[0].write(0);

`vec_split_at_spare` #81944)Returns vector content as a slice of `T`, along with the remaining spare
capacity of the vector as a slice of `MaybeUninit<T>`.

The returned spare capacity slice can be used to fill the vector with data
(e.g. by reading from a file) before marking the data as initialized using
the `set_len` method.

Note that this is a low-level API, which should be used with care for
optimization purposes. If you need to append data to a `Vec`
you can use `push`, `extend`, `extend_from_slice`,
`extend_from_within`, `insert`, `append`, `resize` or
`resize_with`, depending on your exact needs.

`vec_into_chunks` #142137)Groups every `N` elements in the `Vec<T>` into chunks to produce a `Vec<[T; N]>`, dropping
elements in the remainder. `N` must be greater than zero.

If the capacity is not a multiple of the chunk size, the buffer will shrink down to the nearest multiple with a reallocation or deallocation.

This function can be used to reverse `Vec::into_flattened`.

##### §Examples

`vec_recycle` #148227)This clears out this `Vec` and recycles the allocation into a new `Vec`.
The item type of the resulting `Vec` needs to have the same size and
alignment as the item type of the original `Vec`.

##### §Examples

assert_eq!(b.capacity(), capacity);
assert_eq!(b.as_ptr().addr(), addr);
```
The `Recyclable` bound prevents this method from being called when `T` and `U` have different sizes; e.g.:

```
#![feature(vec_recycle, transmutability)]
let vec: Vec<[u8; 2]> = Vec::new();
let _: Vec<[u8; 1]> = vec.recycle();
```
…or different alignments:

```
#![feature(vec_recycle, transmutability)]
let vec: Vec<[u16; 0]> = Vec::new();
let _: Vec<[u8; 0]> = vec.recycle();
```
However, due to temporary implementation limitations of `Recyclable`,
this method is not yet callable when `T` or `U` are slices, trait objects,
or other exotic types; e.g.:

```
#![feature(vec_recycle, transmutability)]
let mut storage: Vec<&[&str]> = Vec::new();

Resizes the `Vec` in-place so that `len` is equal to `new_len`.

If `new_len` is greater than `len`, the `Vec` is extended by the
difference, with each additional slot filled with `value`.
If `new_len` is less than `len`, the `Vec` is simply truncated.

#### pub fn splice<R, I>( &mut self, range: R, replace_with: I, ) -> Splice<'_, <I as IntoIterator>::IntoIter, A> ⓘ

Creates a splicing iterator that replaces the specified range in the vector
with the given `replace_with` iterator and yields the removed items.
`replace_with` does not need to be the same length as `range`.

`range` is removed even if the `Splice` iterator is not consumed before it is dropped.

It is unspecified how many elements are removed from the vector
if the `Splice` value is leaked.

The input iterator `replace_with` is only consumed when the `Splice` value is dropped.

This is optimal if:

- The tail (elements in the vector after `range`) is empty,
- or `replace_with`yields fewer or equal elements than`range`’s length
- or the lower bound of its `size_hint()`is exact.

Otherwise, a temporary vector is allocated and the tail is moved twice.

1.87.0 · Source#### pub fn extract_if<F, R>(
    &mut self,
    range: R,
    filter: F,
) -> ExtractIf<'_, T, F, A> ⓘ

 

#### pub fn extract_if<F, R>( &mut self, range: R, filter: F, ) -> ExtractIf<'_, T, F, A> ⓘ

Creates an iterator which uses a closure to determine if an element in the range should be removed.

If the closure returns `true`, the element is removed from the vector
and yielded. If the closure returns `false`, or panics, the element
remains in the vector and will not be yielded.

Only elements that fall in the provided range are considered for extraction, but any elements after the range will still have to be moved if any element has been extracted.

If the returned `ExtractIf` is not exhausted, e.g. because it is dropped without iterating
or the iteration short-circuits, then the remaining elements will be retained.
Use `extract_if().for_each(drop)` if you do not need the returned iterator,
or `retain_mut` with a negated predicate if you also do not need to restrict the range.

Using this method is equivalent to the following code:

```
let mut i = range.start;
let end_items = vec.len() - range.end;
while i < vec.len() - end_items {
    if some_predicate(&mut vec[i]) {
        let val = vec.remove(i);
        // your code here
    } else {
        i += 1;
    }
}
```
But `extract_if` is easier to use. `extract_if` is also more efficient,
because it can backshift the elements of the array in bulk.

The iterator also lets you mutate the value of each element in the closure, regardless of whether you choose to keep or remove it.

1.0.0 · Source#### pub fn as_ptr(&self) -> *const T

 

#### pub fn as_ptr(&self) -> *const T

Returns a raw pointer to the slice’s buffer.

The caller must ensure that the slice outlives the pointer this function returns, or else it will end up dangling.

The caller must also ensure that the memory the pointer (non-transitively) points to
is never written to (except inside an `UnsafeCell`) using this pointer or any pointer
derived from it. If you need to mutate the contents of the slice, use `as_mut_ptr`.

Modifying the container referenced by this slice may cause its buffer to be reallocated, which would also make any pointers to it invalid.

##### §Examples

##### §Examples

1.48.0 · Source#### pub fn as_ptr_range(&self) -> Range<*const T> ⓘ

 

#### pub fn as_ptr_range(&self) -> Range<*const T> ⓘ

Returns the two raw pointers spanning the slice.

The returned range is half-open, which means that the end pointer
points *one past* the last element of the slice. This way, an empty
slice is represented by two equal pointers, and the difference between
the two pointers represents the size of the slice.

See `as_ptr` for warnings on using these pointers. The end pointer
requires extra caution, as it does not point to a valid element in the
slice.

This function is useful for interacting with foreign interfaces which use two pointers to refer to a range of elements in memory, as is common in C++.

It can also be useful to check if a pointer to an element refers to an element of this slice:

 🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`slice_swap_unchecked` #88539)

#### pub unsafe fn swap_unchecked(&mut self, a: usize, b: usize)

`slice_swap_unchecked` #88539)Swaps two elements in the slice, without doing bounds checking.

For a safe alternative see `swap`.

##### §Arguments

##### §Examples

1.0.0 · Source#### pub fn windows(&self, size: usize) -> Windows<'_, T> ⓘ

 

#### pub fn windows(&self, size: usize) -> Windows<'_, T> ⓘ

Returns an iterator over all contiguous windows of length
`size`. The windows overlap. If the slice is shorter than
`size`, the iterator returns no values.

##### §Panics

Panics if `size` is zero.

##### §Examples

```
let slice = ['l', 'o', 'r', 'e', 'm'];
let mut iter = slice.windows(3);
assert_eq!(iter.next().unwrap(), &['l', 'o', 'r']);
assert_eq!(iter.next().unwrap(), &['o', 'r', 'e']);
assert_eq!(iter.next().unwrap(), &['r', 'e', 'm']);
assert!(iter.next().is_none());
```
If the slice is shorter than `size`:

Because the Iterator trait cannot represent the required lifetimes,
there is no `windows_mut` analog to `windows`;
`[0,1,2].windows_mut(2).collect()` would violate the rules of references
(though a LendingIterator analog is possible). You can sometimes use
`Cell::as_slice_of_cells` in
conjunction with `windows` instead:

```
use std::cell::Cell;
let mut array = ['R', 'u', 's', 't', ' ', '2', '0', '1', '5'];
let slice = &mut array[..];
let slice_of_cells: &[Cell<char>] = Cell::from_mut(slice).as_slice_of_cells();
for w in slice_of_cells.windows(3) {
    Cell::swap(&w[0], &w[2]);
}
assert_eq!(array, ['s', 't', ' ', '2', '0', '1', '5', 'u', 'R']);
```
1.0.0 · Source#### pub fn chunks(&self, chunk_size: usize) -> Chunks<'_, T> ⓘ

 

#### pub fn chunks(&self, chunk_size: usize) -> Chunks<'_, T> ⓘ

Returns an iterator over `chunk_size` elements of the slice at a time, starting at the
beginning of the slice.

The chunks are slices and do not overlap. If `chunk_size` does not divide the length of the
slice, then the last chunk will not have length `chunk_size`.

See `chunks_exact` for a variant of this iterator that returns chunks of always exactly
`chunk_size` elements, and `rchunks` for the same iterator but starting at the end of the
slice.

If your `chunk_size` is a constant, consider using `as_chunks` instead, which will
give references to arrays of exactly that length, rather than slices.

1.31.0 · Source#### pub fn chunks_exact(&self, chunk_size: usize) -> ChunksExact<'_, T> ⓘ

 

#### pub fn chunks_exact(&self, chunk_size: usize) -> ChunksExact<'_, T> ⓘ

Returns an iterator over `chunk_size` elements of the slice at a time, starting at the
beginning of the slice.

The chunks are slices and do not overlap. If `chunk_size` does not divide the length of the
slice, then the last up to `chunk_size-1` elements will be omitted and can be retrieved
from the `remainder` function of the iterator.

Due to each chunk having exactly `chunk_size` elements, the compiler can often optimize the
resulting code better than in the case of `chunks`.

See `chunks` for a variant of this iterator that also returns the remainder as a smaller
chunk, and `rchunks_exact` for the same iterator but starting at the end of the slice.

Splits the slice into a slice of `N`-element arrays,
assuming that there’s no remainder.

This is the inverse operation to `as_flattened`.

As this is `unsafe`, consider whether you could use `as_chunks` or
`as_rchunks` instead, perhaps via something like

1.88.0 · Source#### pub fn as_chunks<const N: usize>(&self) -> (&[[T; N]], &[T])

 

#### pub fn as_chunks<const N: usize>(&self) -> (&[[T; N]], &[T])

Splits the slice into a slice of `N`-element arrays,
starting at the beginning of the slice,
and a remainder slice with length strictly less than `N`.

The remainder is meaningful in the division sense.  Given
`let (chunks, remainder) = slice.as_chunks()`, then:

- `chunks.len()`equals- `slice.len() / N`,
- `remainder.len()`equals- `slice.len() % N`, and
- `slice.len()`equals- `chunks.len() * N + remainder.len()`.

You can flatten the chunks back into a slice-of-`T` with `as_flattened`.

Panics if `N` is zero.

Note that this check is against a const generic parameter, not a runtime value, and thus a particular monomorphization will either always panic or it will never panic.

See `rchunks_exact` for a variant of this iterator that returns chunks of always exactly
`chunk_size` elements, and `chunks` for the same iterator but starting at the beginning
of the slice.

If your `chunk_size` is a constant, consider using `as_rchunks` instead, which will
give references to arrays of exactly that length, rather than slices.

from the `remainder` function of the iterator.

Due to each chunk having exactly `chunk_size` elements, the compiler can often optimize the

Binary searches this slice for a given element. If the slice is not sorted, the returned result is unspecified and meaningless.

If the value is found then `Result::Ok` is returned, containing the
index of the matching element. If there are multiple matches, then any
one of the matches could be returned. The index is chosen
deterministically, but is subject to change in future versions of Rust.
If the value is not found then `Result::Err` is returned, containing
the index where a matching element could be inserted while maintaining
sorted order.

uniquely determined position; the second and third are not
found; the fourth could match any position in `[1, 4]`.

```
let s = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55];
assert_eq!(s.binary_search(&13),  Ok(9));
assert_eq!(s.binary_search(&4),   Err(7));
assert_eq!(s.binary_search(&100), Err(13));
let r = s.binary_search(&1);
assert!(match r { Ok(1..=4) => true, _ => false, });
```
If you want to find that whole *range* of matching items, rather than
an arbitrary matching one, that can be done using `partition_point`:

```
let s = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55];
let low = s.partition_point(|x| x < &1);
assert_eq!(low, 1);
let high = s.partition_point(|x| x <= &1);
assert_eq!(high, 5);
let r = s.binary_search(&1);
assert!((low..high).contains(&r.unwrap()));
assert!(s[..low].iter().all(|&x| x < 1));
assert!(s[low..high].iter().all(|&x| x == 1));
assert!(s[high..].iter().all(|&x| x > 1));
// For something not found, the "range" of equal items is empty
assert_eq!(s.partition_point(|x| x < &11), 9);
assert_eq!(s.partition_point(|x| x <= &11), 9);
assert_eq!(s.binary_search(&11), Err(9));
```
If you want to insert an item to a sorted vector, while maintaining
sort order, consider using `partition_point`:

```
let mut s = vec![0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55];
let num = 42;
let idx = s.partition_point(|&x| x <= num);
// If `num` is unique, `s.partition_point(|&x| x < num)` (with `<`) is equivalent to
// `s.binary_search(&num).unwrap_or_else(|x| x)`, but using `<=` will allow `insert`
// to shift less elements.
s.insert(idx, num);
assert_eq!(s, [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 42, 55]);

#### pub fn binary_search_by<'a, F>(&'a self, f: F) -> Result<usize, usize>

Binary searches this slice with a comparator function.

The comparator function should return an order code that indicates
whether its argument is `Less`, `Equal` or `Greater` the desired
target.
If the slice is not sorted or if the comparator function does not
implement an order consistent with the sort order of the underlying
slice, the returned result is unspecified and meaningless.

If the value is found then `Result::Ok` is returned, containing the
index of the matching element. If there are multiple matches, then any
one of the matches could be returned. The index is chosen
deterministically, but is subject to change in future versions of Rust.
If the value is not found then `Result::Err` is returned, containing
the index where a matching element could be inserted while maintaining
sorted order.

See also `binary_search`, `binary_search_by_key`, and `partition_point`.

##### §Examples

Looks up a series of four elements. The first is found, with a
uniquely determined position; the second and third are not
found; the fourth could match any position in `[1, 4]`.

Binary searches this slice with a key extraction function.

Assumes that the slice is sorted by the key, for instance with
`sort_by_key` using the same key extraction function.
If the slice is not sorted by the key, the returned result is
unspecified and meaningless.

If the value is found then `Result::Ok` is returned, containing the
index of the matching element. If there are multiple matches, then any
one of the matches could be returned. The index is chosen

1.20.0 · Source#### pub fn sort_unstable(&mut self)where
    T: Ord,

 

#### pub fn sort_unstable(&mut self)where
    T: Ord,

Sorts the slice in ascending order **without** preserving the initial order of equal elements.

This sort is unstable (i.e., may reorder equal elements), in-place (i.e., does not
allocate), and *O*(*n* * log(*n*)) worst-case.

If the implementation of `Ord` for `T` does not implement a total order, the function
may panic; even if the function exits normally, the resulting order of elements in the slice
is unspecified. See also the note on panicking below.

For example `|a, b| (a - b).cmp(a)` is a comparison function that is neither transitive nor
reflexive nor total, `a < b < c < a` with `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`. For more information and
examples see the `Ord` documentation.

All original elements will remain in the slice and any possible modifications via interior
mutability are observed in the input. Same is true if the implementation of `Ord` for `T` panics.

Sorting types that only implement `PartialOrd` such as `f32` and `f64` require
additional precautions. For example, `f32::NAN != f32::NAN`, which doesn’t fulfill the
reflexivity requirement of `Ord`. By using an alternative comparison function with
`slice::sort_unstable_by` such as `f32::total_cmp` or `f64::total_cmp` that defines a
total order users can sort slices containing floating-point values. Alternatively, if all
values in the slice are guaranteed to be in a subset for which `PartialOrd::partial_cmp`
forms a total order, it’s possible to sort the slice with `sort_unstable_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())`.

##### §Current implementation

The current implementation is based on ipnsort by Lukas Bergdoll and Orson Peters, which
combines the fast average case of quicksort with the fast worst case of heapsort, achieving
linear time on fully sorted and reversed inputs. On inputs with k distinct elements, the
expected time to sort the data is *O*(*n* * log(*k*)).

It is typically faster than stable sorting, except in a few special cases, e.g., when the slice is partially sorted.

##### §Panics

May panic if the implementation of `Ord` for `T` does not implement a total order, or if
the `Ord` implementation panics.

Reorders the slice such that the element at `index` is at a sort-order position. All

function is also known as “kth element” in other libraries.

Returns a triple that partitions the reordered slice:

- 
The unsorted subslice before `index`, whose elements all satisfy`x <= self[index]`.

 🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`slice_partition_dedup` #54279)

#### pub fn partition_dedup_by<F>(&mut self, same_bucket: F) -> (&mut [T], &mut [T])

`slice_partition_dedup` #54279)Moves all but the first of consecutive elements to the end of the slice satisfying a given equality relation.

Returns two slices. The first contains no consecutive repeated elements. The second contains all the duplicates in no specified order.

The `same_bucket` function is passed references to two elements from the slice and
must determine if the elements compare equal. The elements are passed in opposite order
from their order in the slice, so if `same_bucket(a, b)` returns `true`, `a` is moved
at the end of the slice.

If the slice is sorted, the first returned slice contains no duplicates.

1.26.0 · Source#### pub fn rotate_left(&mut self, mid: usize)

 

#### pub fn rotate_left(&mut self, mid: usize)

Rotates the slice in-place such that the first `mid` elements of the
slice move to the end while the last `self.len() - mid` elements move to
the front.

After calling `rotate_left`, the element previously at index `mid` will
become the first element in the slice.

##### §Panics

This function will panic if `mid` is greater than the length of the
slice. Note that `mid == self.len()` does *not* panic and is a no-op
rotation.

##### §Complexity

Takes linear (in `self.len()`) time.

```
let mut a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'];
a.rotate_left(2);

Copies elements from one part of the slice to another part of itself, using a memmove.

`src` is the range within `self` to copy from. `dest` is the starting
index of the range within `self` to copy to, which will have the same
length as `src`. The two ranges may overlap. The ends of the two ranges
must be less than or equal to `self.len()`.

1.30.0 · Source#### pub unsafe fn align_to<U>(&self) -> (&[T], &[U], &[T])

 

#### pub unsafe fn align_to<U>(&self) -> (&[T], &[U], &[T])

Transmutes the slice to a slice of another type, ensuring alignment of the types is maintained.

This method splits the slice into three distinct slices: prefix, correctly aligned middle slice of a new type, and the suffix slice. The middle part will be as big as possible under the given alignment constraint and element size.

This method has no purpose when either input element `T` or output element `U` are
zero-sized and will return the original slice without splitting anything.

middle slice, so all the usual caveats pertaining to `transmute::<T, U>` also apply here.

Checks if the elements of this slice are sorted.

That is, for each element `a` and its following element `b`, `a <= b` must hold. If the
slice yields exactly zero or one element, `true` is returned.

Note that if `Self::Item` is only `PartialOrd`, but not `Ord`, the above definition
implies that this function returns `false` if any two consecutive items are not
comparable.

Instead of using `PartialOrd::partial_cmp`, this function uses the given `compare`
function to determine whether two elements are to be considered in sorted order.

Checks if the elements of this slice are sorted using the given key extraction function.

Instead of comparing the slice’s elements directly, this function compares the keys of the
elements, as determined by `f`. Apart from that, it’s equivalent to `is_sorted`; see its
documentation for more information.

##### §Examples

1.52.0 · Source#### pub fn partition_point<P>(&self, pred: P) -> usize

 

#### pub fn partition_point<P>(&self, pred: P) -> usize

Returns the index of the partition point according to the given predicate (the index of the first element of the second partition).

The slice is assumed to be partitioned according to the given predicate.
This means that all elements for which the predicate returns true are at the start of the slice
and all elements for which the predicate returns false are at the end.
For example, `[7, 15, 3, 5, 4, 12, 6]` is partitioned under the predicate `x % 2 != 0`
(all odd numbers are at the start, all even at the end).

If this slice is not partitioned, the returned result is unspecified and meaningless, as this method performs a kind of binary search.

See also `binary_search`, `binary_search_by`, and `binary_search_by_key`.

##### §Examples

```
let v = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7];
let i = v.partition_point(|&x| x < 5);
assert_eq!(i, 4);
assert!(v[..i].iter().all(|&x| x < 5));
assert!(v[i..].iter().all(|&x| !(x < 5)));
```
If all elements of the slice match the predicate, including if the slice is empty, then the length of the slice will be returned:

```
let a = [2, 4, 8];
assert_eq!(a.partition_point(|x| x < &100), a.len());
let a: [i32; 0] = [];
assert_eq!(a.partition_point(|x| x < &100), 0);

#### pub unsafe fn get_disjoint_unchecked_mut<I, const N: usize>( &mut self, indices: [I; N], ) -> [&mut <I as SliceIndex<[T]>>::Output; N]

Returns mutable references to many indices at once, without doing any checks.

An index can be either a `usize`, a `Range` or a `RangeInclusive`. Note
that this method takes an array, so all indices must be of the same type.
If passed an array of `usize`s this method gives back an array of mutable references
to single elements, while if passed an array of ranges it gives back an array of
mutable references to slices.

#### pub fn get_disjoint_mut<I, const N: usize>( &mut self, indices: [I; N], ) -> Result<[&mut <I as SliceIndex<[T]>>::Output; N], GetDisjointMutError>

Returns mutable references to many indices at once.

An index can be either a `usize`, a `Range` or a `RangeInclusive`. Note
that this method takes an array, so all indices must be of the same type.
If passed an array of `usize`s this method gives back an array of mutable references
to single elements, while if passed an array of ranges it gives back an array of
mutable references to slices.

Returns an error if any index is out-of-bounds, or if there are overlapping indices. An empty range is not considered to overlap if it is located at the beginning or at the end of another range, but is considered to overlap if it is located in the middle.

This method does a O(n^2) check to check that there are no overlapping indices, so be careful when passing many indices.

##### §Examples

```
let v = &mut [1, 2, 3];
if let Ok([a, b]) = v.get_disjoint_mut([0, 2]) {

#### pub fn element_offset(&self, element: &T) -> Option<usize>

Returns the index that an element reference points to.

Returns `None` if `element` does not point to the start of an element within the slice.

This method is useful for extending slice iterators like `slice::split`.

Note that this uses pointer arithmetic and **does not compare elements**.
To find the index of an element via comparison, use
`.iter().position()` instead.

##### §Panics

Panics if `T` is zero-sized.

##### §Examples

Basic usage:

```
let nums: &[u32] = &[1, 7, 1, 1];
let num = &nums[2];
assert_eq!(num, &1);
assert_eq!(nums.element_offset(num), Some(2));
```
Returning `None` with an unaligned element:

```
let arr: &[[u32; 2]] = &[[0, 1], [2, 3]];
let flat_arr: &[u32] = arr.as_flattened();
let ok_elm: &[u32; 2] = flat_arr[0..2].try_into().unwrap();
let weird_elm: &[u32; 2] = flat_arr[1..3].try_into().unwrap();
assert_eq!(ok_elm, &[0, 1]);
assert_eq!(weird_elm, &[1, 2]);
assert_eq!(arr.element_offset(ok_elm), Some(0)); // Points to element 0
assert_eq!(arr.element_offset(weird_elm), None); // Points between element 0 and 1

#### pub fn subslice_range(&self, subslice: &[T]) -> Option<Range<usize>>

`substr_range` #126769)Returns the range of indices that a subslice points to.

Returns `None` if `subslice` does not point within the slice or if it is not aligned with the
elements in the slice.

This method **does not compare elements**. Instead, this method finds the location in the slice that
`subslice` was obtained from. To find the index of a subslice via comparison, instead use
`.windows()``.position()`.

This method is useful for extending slice iterators like `slice::split`.

Note that this may return a false positive (either `Some(0..0)` or `Some(self.len()..self.len())`)
if `subslice` has a length of zero and points to the beginning or end of another, separate, slice.

1.0.0 · Source#### pub fn sort(&mut self)where
    T: Ord,

 

#### pub fn sort(&mut self)where
    T: Ord,

Sorts the slice in ascending order, preserving initial order of equal elements.

This sort is stable (i.e., does not reorder equal elements) and *O*(*n* * log(*n*))
worst-case.

If the implementation of `Ord` for `T` does not implement a total order, the function
may panic; even if the function exits normally, the resulting order of elements in the slice
is unspecified. See also the note on panicking below.

When applicable, unstable sorting is preferred because it is generally faster than stable
sorting and it doesn’t allocate auxiliary memory. See
`sort_unstable`. The exception are partially sorted slices, which
may be better served with `slice::sort`.

Sorting types that only implement `PartialOrd` such as `f32` and `f64` require
additional precautions. For example, `f32::NAN != f32::NAN`, which doesn’t fulfill the
reflexivity requirement of `Ord`. By using an alternative comparison function with
`slice::sort_by` such as `f32::total_cmp` or `f64::total_cmp` that defines a total
order users can sort slices containing floating-point values. Alternatively, if all values
in the slice are guaranteed to be in a subset for which `PartialOrd::partial_cmp` forms a
total order, it’s possible to sort the slice with `sort_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())`.

##### §Current implementation

The current implementation is based on driftsort by Orson Peters and Lukas Bergdoll, which
combines the fast average case of quicksort with the fast worst case and partial run
detection of mergesort, achieving linear time on fully sorted and reversed inputs. On inputs
with k distinct elements, the expected time to sort the data is *O*(*n* * log(*k*)).

The auxiliary memory allocation behavior depends on the input length. Short slices are
handled without allocation, medium sized slices allocate `self.len()` and beyond that it
clamps at `self.len() / 2`.

##### §Panics

May panic if the implementation of `Ord` for `T` does not implement a total order, or if
the `Ord` implementation itself panics.

All safe functions on slices preserve the invariant that even if the function panics, all
original elements will remain in the slice and any possible modifications via interior
mutability are observed in the input. This ensures that recovery code (for instance inside
of a `Drop` or following a `catch_unwind`) will still have access to all the original
elements. For instance, if the slice belongs to a `Vec`, the `Vec::drop` method will be able
to dispose of all contained elements.

##### §Examples

Sorts the slice in ascending order with a comparison function, preserving initial order of equal elements.

This sort is stable (i.e., does not reorder equal elements) and *O*(*n* * log(*n*))
worst-case.

If the comparison function `compare` does not implement a total order, the function may
panic; even if the function exits normally, the resulting order of elements in the slice is
unspecified. See also the note on panicking below.

For example `|a, b| (a - b).cmp(a)` is a comparison function that is neither transitive nor
reflexive nor total, `a < b < c < a` with `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`. For more information and
examples see the `Ord` documentation.

#### pub fn sort_by_cached_key<K, F>(&mut self, f: F)

Sorts the slice in ascending order with a key extraction function, preserving initial order of equal elements.

This sort is stable (i.e., does not reorder equal elements) and *O*(*m* * *n* + *n* *
log(*n*)) worst-case, where the key function is *O*(*m*).

During sorting, the key function is called at most once per element, by using temporary storage to remember the results of key evaluation. The order of calls to the key function is unspecified and may change in future versions of the standard library.

If the implementation of `Ord` for `K` does not implement a total order, the function
may panic; even if the function exits normally, the resulting order of elements in the slice
is unspecified. See also the note on panicking below.

For simple key functions (e.g., functions that are property accesses or basic operations),
`sort_by_key` is likely to be faster.

##### §Current implementation

The current implementation is based on instruction-parallel-network sort by Lukas
Bergdoll, which combines the fast average case of randomized quicksort with the fast worst
case of heapsort, while achieving linear time on fully sorted and reversed inputs. And
*O*(*k* * log(*n*)) where *k* is the number of distinct elements in the input. It leverages
superscalar out-of-order execution capabilities commonly found in CPUs, to efficiently
perform the operation.

In the worst case, the algorithm allocates temporary storage in a `Vec<(K, usize)>` the
length of the slice.

##### §Panics

May panic if the implementation of `Ord` for `K` does not implement a total order, or if
the `Ord` implementation panics.

### impl<T> FromIterator<T> for Vec<T>

Collects an iterator into a Vec, commonly called via `Iterator::collect()`

#### §Allocation behavior

In general `Vec` does not guarantee any particular growth or allocation strategy.
That also applies to this trait impl.

**Note:** This section covers implementation details and is therefore exempt from
stability guarantees.

Vec may use any or none of the following strategies, depending on the supplied iterator:

- preallocate based on `Iterator::size_hint()`- and panic if the number of items is outside the provided lower/upper bounds
 
- use an amortized growth strategy similar to `pushing`one item at a time
- perform the iteration in-place on the original allocation backing the iterator

The last case warrants some attention. It is an optimization that in many cases reduces peak memory
consumption and improves cache locality. But when big, short-lived allocations are created,
only a small fraction of their items get collected, no further use is made of the spare capacity
and the resulting `Vec` is moved into a longer-lived structure, then this can lead to the large
allocations having their lifetimes unnecessarily extended which can result in increased memory
footprint.

In cases where this is an issue, the excess capacity can be discarded with `Vec::shrink_to()`,
`Vec::shrink_to_fit()` or by collecting into `Box<[T]>` instead, which additionally reduces
the size of the long-lived struct.

```
static LONG_LIVED: Mutex<Vec<Vec<u16>>> = Mutex::new(Vec::new());
for i in 0..10 {
    let big_temporary: Vec<u16> = (0..1024).collect();
    // discard most items
    let mut result: Vec<_> = big_temporary.into_iter().filter(|i| i % 100 == 0).collect();
    // without this a lot of unused capacity might be moved into the global
    result.shrink_to_fit();
    LONG_LIVED.lock().unwrap().push(result);
}
```
